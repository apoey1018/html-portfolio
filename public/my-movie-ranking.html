<h2>Here are my favorite 3 movies I had ever watched</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</h3>
<p>
    This is the movie that introduced me to the magical world of the Harry Potter series.
    It is a well-adapted movie that sets the background for the rest of the books and films going forward.

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>
    This movie has an interesting portrayal of Batman and the Joker that is somewhat grounded. 
    I find the joker interesting here. He seems to revel too much in regards to what he does, but that makes him a great villain.
</p>

<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>
    The special effects of this movie are wonderful for its time and is still felt alive in the modern day.
    This got me into dinosaurs as a young child.
